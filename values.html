          In our self-talks we fight for our values & beliefs. They are based on
          our education, experiences and environment. At least 80% of our
          personality is formed until the age of 7 years. In this phase of life,
          we accept what our parents, family, friends, teachers, neighbors, etc.
          tell us and live by example without really questioning it.<br />
          But is it really true
