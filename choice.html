            It is your choice to stop your thoughts and to ask yourself if
            yourself thoughts are really true. If they are
            <em>not</em> true - we can let them go. If they are still true for
            us - we are now aware of them and we can handle them the way WE
            want. We are not our feelings. WE decide about our feelings. <br />
            It is up to us to choose every moment if we want to be happy or not.
